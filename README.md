Bouncy-Castle-AES-GCM-Encryption
================================

Initial code based off this [Stack Overflow question](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/14892/review-of-simplified-secure-encryption-of-a-string) by James Tuley.

This code sample shows how to use the [BouncyCastle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BouncyCastle/) library to perform encryption and decryption using AES-GCM 256bit.
